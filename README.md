A JavaScript simulation for studying the fictional deep-sea organism **Pila aequor (P. aequor)**, developed as part of the Codecademy *Challenge Project: Mysterious Organism*.  
This program generates, mutates, and compares DNA strands to model survival probabilities under specific conditions.

---

## Project Overview

**Context:**  
P. aequor is a newly discovered species found near hydrothermal vents, with DNA comprised of **15 bases**. Due to its rarity and inability to survive above sea level, researchers require a simulation to study its properties without repeated deep-sea expeditions.

**Your role:**  
Create JavaScript objects to simulate P. aequorâ€™s DNA, mutations, DNA comparisons, and survival chances.

**Main Features Implemented:**
- Generate random DNA strands.
- Mutate a DNA base ensuring the new base differs from the original.
- Compare DNA between specimens and return similarity percentage.
- Determine survival likelihood based on DNA composition (â‰¥ 60% C/G bases).
- Create a collection of **30 specimens guaranteed to survive**.

---

## Tech Stack

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Node.js** (for running the script locally)
- **Tools**: Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub

## How It Works

1. **Random DNA Base Generation**  
   - `returnRandBase()` â†’ returns `'A'`, `'T'`, `'C'`, or `'G'` at random.

2. **Random DNA Strand Creation**  
   - `mockUpStrand()` â†’ creates an array of 15 random DNA bases.

3. **Specimen Factory**  
   - `pAequorFactory(specimenNum, dna)` â†’ returns an object with:
     - `.mutate()` â†’ changes one random base to a different base.
     - `.compareDNA(otherSpecimen)` â†’ compares DNA and logs similarity.
     - `.willLikelySurvive()` â†’ returns `true` if at least 60% bases are `C` or `G`.

4. **Survival Simulation**  
   - Generates **30 unique specimens** that pass the survival test.

## Example Output

specimen #2 and specimen #3 have 46% DNA in common

[
  { specimenNum: 1, dna: [ 'C', 'G', 'T', ... ] },
  { specimenNum: 3, dna: [ 'G', 'C', 'C', ... ] },
  ...
]

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Factory functions in JavaScript
- Loops and array manipulation
- Conditional logic and probability
- Ensuring randomness with constraints
- Simulating biological processes through code

---

## Future Improvements

- Add a method to generate a population with configurable size and survival threshold.
- Implement a visual DNA strand representation in a browser.
- Track mutation history for each specimen.
