If you’d like to challenge yourself further, you could consider the following:

- Create a .complementStrand() method to the factory function’s object that returns the complementary DNA strand. The rules are that 'A's match with 'T's and vice versa. Also, 'C's match with 'G's and vice versa. (Check the hint for more details)
- Use the .compareDNA() to find the two most related instances of pAequor.
